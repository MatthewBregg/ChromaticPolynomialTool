[[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/394616/running-jar-file-on-windows][See this tutorial on running jars!]]
** Mac/Linux
- Install java
- Open a terminal
- java -jar thejarfile.jar
  
* Directions
Click on the white area to add a node.

The node has a black boundary in which other nodes cannot be placed (to keep the red circles from overlapping.).

To add a new edge, click on the red of a node center, and then drag to the red of another node center, and release.

Once some nodes are added, click the calculate chromatic polynomial button to calculate a chromatic polynomial!

(IF the button isn't visible, try scrolling/resizing.)
